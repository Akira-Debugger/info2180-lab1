        <p>I am a student at the University of the West indies.I am interested in web developement as I am fascinated by the concept of the Internet and how everything works there. There definetly is more to web development than its relation to the Internet but seeing as how the Internet is a part of my everyday life, I have been curious as how even a part of it works and what is required to mainain one of humanity's greatest creations.</p>
